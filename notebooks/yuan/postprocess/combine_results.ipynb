Equipment and patient positioning  \\n   • The patient lies on a motorised table that slides into a cylindrical superconducting magnet (typically 1.5 T or 3 T field strength).  \\n   • A dedicated head (or head-and-neck) RF coil surrounds the skull. The coil both transmits the RF pulses and receives the returning MR signals, giving high signal-to-noise in the brain.  \\n   • Ear protection is worn because the gradient coils make loud knocking sounds.\\n\\n3. Pulse sequence  \\n   • This particular image is a T2-weighted fast-spin-echo (FSE) or turbo-spin-echo sequence.  \\n   • Parameters are chosen so that water/CSF appears bright and fat/white matter are intermediate-to-dark, helping to highlight oedema, tumours, infarcts, demyelination, etc.  \\n     – Typical values: TR ≈ 3000–6000 ms, TE ≈ 80–120 ms, echo-train length 8–16.  \\n   • Multiple 2- to 5-mm-thick axial slices are acquired covering the entire brain.\\n\\n4. Image formation  \\n   • Three orthogonal gradient coils (x, y, z) are switched on and off rapidly to encode spatial information (frequency and phase encoding).  \\n   • The raw data (k-space) are mathematically reconstructed by a Fourier transform into the 2-D image you see.  \\n   • Intensities are displayed in grey scale; in T2 weighting, fluid = bright.\\n\\n5. Post-processing and display  \\n   • Slices can be further reformatted into coronal, sagittal, or 3-D volumes.  \\n   • Annotations (slice number, sequence name, parameters, patient study details) are added by the scanner console software.\\n\\n6. Safety considerations  \\n   • Screening for ferromagnetic implants or devices is essential.  \\n   • The strong static field, gradient switching, and RF energy deposition (SAR) are monitored to stay within safety limits.\\n\\nIn short: the image was obtained with a fast-spin-echo T2-weighted MRI sequence using a head coil inside a high-field superconducting magnet, with the patient supine and the scanner capturing multiple axial slices through the brain.',\n",

Acute hemorrhage (1-3 days) typically shows deoxyhemoglobin and is hypointense on T2. Early subacute phases (3-7 days) show methemoglobin. Chronic stages (14+ days) reveal hemosiderin and ferritin, with distinct rim patterns.
